<p>It is best to learn the history of why red Roses are the symbol of romance and love. From the Western culture, it has been believed that this type of flower was created by the goddess of love, Aphrodite. According to the legend, her tears and her lover, Adonisâ€™, blood watered the ground from where the red Roses grew. It was then a symbol of love until death.
In Roman Mythology, it was reported and observed that wealthy Romans prefer the flowers of red Roses to associate beauty and love. The goddesses love to pamper their body with a bath filled with Roses while some of them filled their bedchambers and bedrooms with flowers and petals of red Roses because of the pleasant smell and for soft skin.
Another legend for its romantic significance was the belief of the early Christians that this flower was the virtue of the Virgin Mary. Because of the beliefs and mythology, it became the ultimate symbol of passionate love and romance.
The relation and association of red Roses to romance and love go beyond tradition, cultures, and beliefs. Red Roses are also linked to intimacy and passionate emotions because of their deeper meaning and symbolism. According to the professional florist, the color of red and the flower of Roses both refer to affection, love, and admiration. Bright red Roses symbolize romance while burgundy and crimson red Roses mean undying love. A budding red Rose, on the other hand, refers to a type of love that is still blooming or at a young stage.
