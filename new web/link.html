<h1>One Perfect Rose</h1>
<h2>Dorothy Parker</h2>

<p>A single flow'r he sent me, since we met.
<br>All tenderly his messenger he chose;
<br>Deep-hearted, pure, with scented dew still wet--
<br>One perfect rose.
<br>I knew the language of the floweret;
<br>"My fragile leaves," it said, "his heart enclose."
<br>Love long has taken for his amulet
<br>One perfect rose.

<br>Why is it no one ever sent me yet
<br>One perfect limousine, do you suppose?
<br>Ah no, it's always just my luck to get
<br>One perfect rose.
